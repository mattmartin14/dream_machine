the name of the rust project (in this case "fast_writer") also has to be the name of the module inside lib.rs

the docs for py03 actually do a good job outlining how to do all this stuff:
https://crates.io/crates/pyo3

i didnt use maturin init
instead i did cargo new fast_writer --lib

you need a python virt environment to build and test this stuff

then use maturin to build the python code after its written in rust

next steps: 
add a function in rust to write 10M rows to a text file
add same function in python to illustrate the stark difference
