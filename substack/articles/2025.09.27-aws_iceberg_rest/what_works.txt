what works
- simple update (no joins)
- simple delete (no joins)
- basic insert
- insert/select/left join where null
- merge
- complex merge with multiple predicates including deletes

what doesn't work
- ctas: aws docs indicate "Stage create" isn't supported: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/iceberg-rest-apis.html
    -- see section "CreateTable" and limitations
-- workaround: pre-create the skeleton table, then just do an overwrite
- update with joins (workaround use merge)
- delete with joins (workaround use merge)
