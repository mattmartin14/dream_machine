### Overview

I use REST calls often to fetch data as part of a data engineering task. Whether it's tracking information from UPS/Fedex or getting a status of an Order, REST calls are a common avenue that Data Engineers need to know in many jobs. They need to be competant at running the web request, parsing the payload, and pushing the results to a database. But out of curiousity...how does a web request server actually work and serve up data to a user? This project walks through explaining that; we will build a web request server that can serve up 2 different URL's of data back to the user. One of the URL's will go hit an API directly; another will query the data out of a Postgres database and send it back to the user.
