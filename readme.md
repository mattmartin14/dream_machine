### The Dream Machine

You have stumbled upon Matt's brain dump. I am a big data engineer by trait, but like to experiment with other programming languages.

Currently, I'm on a journey of learnign Go Lang, as I see it as a very benefitial programming language for data engineering when you need to process things in parallel.

I also have an old repo in here called "sqletl" which automated the assembly and execution of SSIS packages on the fly.
