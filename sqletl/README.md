## This was my first professional application I built back in 2016

The application installs on SQL Servers versions 2012-2017. It programatically creates and executes SSIS packages on the fly from SQL commands. This helped accelerate ETL work for teams that did not want to learn SSIS and needed a way to take some simple sql templates, tweak some parameters and then move the data quick
